2. **Work:** Create a feature branch, link it to the issue
3. **Code Review:** Create a PR, move issue to In Review / QA
4. **Merge:** Once approved, merge PR and move issue to Done
5. **Update Board:** Move issues manually as status changes (or use GitHub Project Automation)

### For Team Lead
- Review backlog weekly; align on priorities and dependencies
- Unblock In Progress issues; resolve conflicts
- Update Kanban.md after each milestone (or automate via GitHub Projects)
- Track velocity (completed story points / sprint)

### For Product
- Review Done column for completed features
- Prioritize new Backlog items based on impact
- Monitor critical path (issues marked `critical`)
